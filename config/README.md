# DEPRECATION NOTICE

The code in this subdirectory ("config") is likely to be deprecated soon.
It's being left here as a reference for what Spinnaker YAML config files
"look like".  It will likely be ported into a separate library specific to
the handling of Spinnaker configuration file processing (which isn't as
simple as just loading a single YAML file).
